I remember getting a standing ovation at the MDW-meta tranning by kemmcom at our school.
Loooking back I've come so far a new modern javascrpit and react with typescript I must do a second version with speed increase and more graphics.
The graphics of the running and the obstacle made the game looks even better, imagine what new physics and randomization of obstacles would do
in the new version.(for shadowing lmao:])
